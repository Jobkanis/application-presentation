  <content>This application allows you to create HTML5 presentations by transforming a wiki page into a presentation.

It works by following some simple rules and then by applying a special skin to the presentation page.

To learn how to use it you can:
* [[Read the documentation&gt;&gt;http://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/Presentation+Application]]
* Check out this [[Example Presentation about XWiki&gt;&gt;Presentation.XWikiPresentation]]
